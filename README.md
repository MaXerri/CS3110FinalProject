This was a semester long long comulative project in a functional programming class where we constructed a version of Minesweeper.  The original repository was on a Cornell github account and when transferring code to this personal acccount the commits and contributors were messged up.  The lines of code are not correct after I transferred the code over.  installation instructions can be found in the file INSTALL.txt.
